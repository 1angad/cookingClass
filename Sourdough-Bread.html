    <h2>I. Ingredients: </h2>

        <li>50g Whole Wheat Flour</li>
        <li>10g Salt</li>
        <li>100g Active Sourdough Starter</li>
        <li>175ml Very Hot Water</li>
        <li>375g Warm Water (at 90F)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools Needed: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large Mixing Bowl</li>
        <li>Cloth Towel or Plastic Wrap</li>
        <li>Banneton or Medium Size Bowl</li>
        <li>Food Thermometer</li>
        <li>Pen and Paper</li>
        <li>Dough Scraper</li>
        <li>Bench Knife</li>
        <li>Dutch Oven</li>
        <li>Parchment Paper</li>
        <li>Razor Blade/Lame</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Notes: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>*Active sourdough starter is the most important step in your sourdough journey. To begin a loaf you must first have a healthy, ACTIVE sourdough starter. You know your sourdough starter is active when it grows 3 time in size after a feeding and it's ready to use right as the starter begins to collapse.</li>
        <li>** All of the times are unique to your climate. Sourdough is strongly dependent of the temperature of your dough, water, and the environment your bread is proofing in. As a guide, my dough temperaure ranges from 77-80F and kept in a oven with the light on which is kept at 78-82F. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. Baking Schedule:</h2>
    <h4>2 Days Before the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>9:00am</b> Feed your starter with a 1:5:5 ratio. (20g of starter, 100g of flour, 100g of warm water)</li>
      <li> Place your starter in a warm environment (Bear in mind, the warmer the enivironment and the lower the ratio, the faster it will rise)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>1 Day Before the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>8:00am</b> Autolyse. Warm your water to about ~90F and roughly mix just your flour mixture and 325g of your water. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and place into your warm environment beside your starter.</li>
      <li><b>9:00am</b> Mix in Starter and Salt. Add in your starter, salt, and remaining 50g of water. You should mix until the dough comes together and is smooth (5-10 minute breaks can be taken if the dough becomes too sticky to relax the gluten but don't spend longer than 30 minutes on this step). This is the beginning of bulk </li>
      <li><b>9:30am</b> Stretch and Folds. A set of 3 stretch and folds will be done every 30 minutes after you finish mixing. To stretch and fold you're going to stretch the dough and fold it on top of the side it is is adjacent to and cover and place back into warm enviroment after the folds are completed (see video).</li>
      <li><b>9:45 - 11:15am</b> Remainder of Bulk Fermentation. Leave your dough in the warm evironment and let it rise until the dough is domed, airy, and jiggles while the bowl is gently shaked. </li>
      <li><b>12:55pm</b> Prepare Banneton. Grab your banneton or bowl and place a cloth liner or kitchen towel and dusty lightly with flour. </li>
      <li><b>1:00pm</b> Shape (Boule). Light flour your work surface and hands and gently dump dough onto work surface. Gently grabbing both the left and right side, gently create some tension and place back down. Now grabbing the bottom of the dough (closes to you), fold onto the middle dough. Grabbing the left and right side again, fold one on top of the other onto the middle of the dough. The top side you will gently grab all the way to the bottom, and gently pull dough seam side down. Grab your lightly floured bench knife with your dominant hand and use it to create tension on the boule as you rotate the dough in a circular motion against your hand and bench knife. Gently scoop dough into prepared banneton.</li>
      <li><b>1:15pm - 9:00am</b> Cold Retard. Wrap your banneton in plastic wrap and place in a plastic bag and place in a 42F refrigerator overnight (anywhere from 8-24 hours is fine, bearing in mind the longer the cold retard, the more sour the flavor).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Day of the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>8:00am</b> Preheat Dutch Oven. Place your oven rack on the 3rd to bottom slot and preheat oven to 425F. Place your dutch oven without the lid on and place the lid beside </li>
      <li><b>9:00am</b> Bake Dough. Grabbing a sheet pan and line it with parchment paper. Remove dough from fridge and place sheet pan on top of the dough and flip upside down. Holding your lame at a 45 degree angle, quickly score your dough about 1/4 inch deep, straight down the middle of the loaf. Place dough in oven and bake for 50 minutes. 20 minutes into the bake remove the lid and let dough bake for the remaining 30 minutes. </li>
      <li><b>9:50am</b> Cooling. Sourdough loaves have to cool completely to complete baking. Place loaf on a wire rack and allow dough to cool for at least 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) before slicing.</li>
      <li><b>12:00pm</b> Enjoy your loaf!</li>
    </ol>
