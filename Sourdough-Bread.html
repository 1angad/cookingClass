        <p>Do you have an endless amount of freetime to solely dedicate to feeding a live culture? Do you have so much flour you don't know what to do with yourself? Then baking your own artisan-style sourdough is right for you!</p>

<p>In the annals of culinary history, there exists a tale of bread that transcends time, dating back thousands of years to ancient Egypt. It's the story of sourdough breadâ€”a time-honored tradition that has journeyed through centuries and across continents. The saga begins in the heart of the Nile, circa 1500 BC. In the shadow of the great pyramids, a baker named Tariq stumbled upon a discovery that would change the course of breadmaking. Mixing humble flour and water, he left the concoction exposed to the arid desert air. To his astonishment, the mixture fermented, yielding a loaf of bread unlike any that had graced his oven. What Tariq had unwittingly harnessed was a natural miracle: the alchemy of wild yeast and beneficial bacteria. These microorganisms, mainly lactobacillus and wild yeast strains, initiated the fermentation process that gave sourdough its unique character.</p>

<p>The word "sourdough" itself didn't find its way into the English language until the 19th century, but the practice had ancient roots. From Egypt, it spread through the Mediterranean and the cultures of Greece and Rome. The art of sourdough baking became a revered tradition, and its secrets were passed down from one generation to the next. As history unfolded, sourdough bread was a mainstay in the diets of early American settlers. Its reliability in challenging conditions made it a valued companion on the arduous journey westward. During the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century, miners and settlers relied on sourdough as a source of sustenance.

In modern times, sourdough bread has experienced a renaissance. The artisanal bread movement, coupled with a growing appreciation for traditional and slow-fermentation methods, has brought sourdough back into the spotlight. It's no longer just a staple; it's a symbol of artistry and a connection to centuries-old practices. Beyond its rich flavor and texture, sourdough fermentation has also been associated with potential health benefits. It aids digestion and enhances the nutritional profile of the bread, making it a preferred choice for health-conscious consumers.</p>

<p>Today, sourdough bread continues to capture the imagination of bakers, food enthusiasts, and those who appreciate the authentic and the time-honored. It's a testament to the enduring legacy of a bread that transcends history and bridges the gap between ancient traditions and the modern world.</p>

<p>Now you too can join this rich history like the millions of bakers who have dedicated their time to perfect this rich, historical craft. Below is my own personal recipe.</p>

                <h2>Important Notes: </h2>
                    <ul>
        <li>*Active sourdough starter is the most important step in your sourdough journey. To begin a loaf you must first have a healthy, ACTIVE sourdough starter. You know your sourdough starter is active when it grows 3 time in size after a feeding and it's ready to use right as the starter begins to collapse.</li>
        <li>** All of the times are unique to your climate. Sourdough is strongly dependent of the temperature of your dough, water, and the environment your bread is proofing in. As a guide, my dough temperaure ranges from 77-80F and kept in a oven with the light on which is kept at 78-82F. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. Baking Schedule:</h2>
    <h4>2 Days Before the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>9:00pm</b> Feed your starter with a 1:5:5 ratio. (20g of starter, 100g of flour, 100g of warm water)</li>
      <li> Place your starter in a warm environment (Bear in mind, the warmer the enivironment and the lower the ratio, the faster it will rise)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>1 Day Before the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>8:00am</b> Autolyse. Warm your water to about ~90F and roughly mix just your flour mixture and 325g of your water. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and place into your warm environment beside your starter.</li>
      <li><b>9:00am</b> Mix in Starter and Salt. Add in your starter, salt, and remaining 50g of water. You should mix until the dough comes together and is smooth (5-10 minute breaks can be taken if the dough becomes too sticky to relax the gluten but don't spend longer than 30 minutes on this step). This is the beginning of bulk </li>
      <li><b>9:30am</b> Stretch and Folds. A set of 3 stretch and folds will be done every 30 minutes after you finish mixing. To stretch and fold you're going to stretch the dough and fold it on top of the side it is is adjacent to and cover and place back into warm enviroment after the folds are completed (see video).</li>
      <li><b>9:45 - 11:15am</b> Remainder of Bulk Fermentation. Leave your dough in the warm evironment and let it rise until the dough is domed, airy, and jiggles while the bowl is gently shaked. </li>
      <li><b>12:55pm</b> Prepare Banneton. Grab your banneton or bowl and place a cloth liner or kitchen towel and dusty lightly with flour. </li>
      <li><b>1:00pm</b> Shape (Boule). Light flour your work surface and hands and gently dump dough onto work surface. Gently grabbing both the left and right side, gently create some tension and place back down. Now grabbing the bottom of the dough (closes to you), fold onto the middle dough. Grabbing the left and right side again, fold one on top of the other onto the middle of the dough. The top side you will gently grab all the way to the bottom, and gently pull dough seam side down. Grab your lightly floured bench knife with your dominant hand and use it to create tension on the boule as you rotate the dough in a circular motion against your hand and bench knife. Gently scoop dough into prepared banneton.</li>
      <li><b>1:15pm - 9:00am</b> Cold Retard. Wrap your banneton in plastic wrap and place in a plastic bag and place in a 42F refrigerator overnight (anywhere from 8-24 hours is fine, bearing in mind the longer the cold retard, the more sour the flavor).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Day of the Bake</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b>8:00am</b> Preheat Dutch Oven. Place your oven rack on the 3rd to bottom slot and preheat oven to 425F. Place your dutch oven without the lid on and place the lid beside </li>
      <li><b>9:00am</b> Bake Dough. Grabbing a sheet pan and line it with parchment paper. Remove dough from fridge and place sheet pan on top of the dough and flip upside down. Holding your lame at a 45 degree angle, quickly score your dough about 1/4 inch deep, straight down the middle of the loaf. Place dough in oven and bake for 50 minutes. 20 minutes into the bake remove the lid and let dough bake for the remaining 30 minutes. </li>
      <li><b>9:50am</b> Cooling. Sourdough loaves have to cool completely to complete baking. Place loaf on a wire rack and allow dough to cool for at least 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) before slicing.</li>
      <li><b>12:00pm</b> Enjoy your loaf!</li>
    </ol>
