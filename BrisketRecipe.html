            Brisket! Who doesn't love a nice, juicy slice of Texas heaven. While I've only ever been to the Lone Star State once, when I was 6, I'm a big fan of the barbecue staple. I won't bore you with the history of brisket and Texas BBQ as a whole, but I will bore you with the reason I made one last weekend and why this recipe is literally the greatest that's ever been made. <br>

            I've always loved brisket and BBQ as a whole, but I've been pretty scared to actually tackle it myself. I remember years ago, when my mom tried making it in an electric smoker and she ended up cutting all the fat off, making it inedible and extremely tough to chew (my mom is an amazing cook who is the entire reason I'm such a big fan of cooking). Before the past month or so, we've always made BBQ in an Instant Pot or in the oven, and smoking has always been kinda hard to do in our eyes. <br>

            This all changed when my brother and I visited our cousin and her fiance in St. Louis this summer. We had a great BBQ and her fiance smoked up some truly amazing brisket on a tiny Weber Kettle charcoal grill. I thought you had to have a giant smoker made of old propane tanks and redneck engineering in order to have great BBQ, but I was wrong. This was some of the best brisket I'd ever eaten. This is what the zoomers would call a "Canon Event" because it changed the course of my life entirely. <br>

            I meandered on about that beautiful day, wondering if I could ever try BBQ on my own. I remembered that we have an old kettle sitting in the basement (which was conveniently cleaned out because we're finishing it) and diceded to give it a try. I bought a pork shoulder and made it on the old grill, realizing that it actually wasn't that hard to do 'low and slow' in the backyard. I made it another time before I decided that I was ready to conquer the almighty brisket. I woke up at 3am to start it, anticipating it to take all day, and low and behold, I made some really good brisket. <br>

            Anyway, here's the recipe! (Please note that outdoor cooking and BBQ is pretty finicky to make consistently, so cooking times depend on a bunch of factors such as: outdoor temperature, size of the meat, humidity, time of day, etc.)

        <h2>III. Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Light charcoal in chimney starter: use a wad of paper and cover with neutral cooking oil. Light with a lighter. Place under the chimney starter and fill the starter with charcoal (You will need to do this several times throughout the cooking process)</li>
            <li>Place a pan filled ~half way with water on top of the fuel grate on one side.</li>
            <li>Once charcoal is white hot, dump charcoal onto the other side of the fuel grate and place 1-2 wood chunks on top (depending on the size).</li>
            <li>Place the grill grate above the fuel grate. Place an ambient temperature probe on the grill grate above the water pan.</li>
            <li>Place the grill lid with the air vent side above the water pan.</li>

            <li>Place brisket back on the grill for 2-4 hours, or until the internal temperature of both the flat and point of brisket is at 200-205 degrees F and the temperature probe penetrates the meat like room temperature butter.</li>
            <li>Remove brisket from the grill, place in a low-temp oven for at least 2 hours and until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
